# 📊 Uber Ride Analytics Database

This project is a PostgreSQL database + SQL analytics toolkit designed to simulate and analyze an Uber-style ride booking system.
This SQL file defines the uber_ride database with schema, sample data import, and analytical queries. It captures bookings, customers, drivers, payments, distances, ratings, and cancellations. Included queries explore ride counts, revenue trends, top customers/drivers, cancellations, and booking value insights.

🔹 What’s inside?

- A rich schema (uber_ride) capturing bookings, customers, drivers, payments, ride distances, ratings, and cancellations.

- Data import pipeline from CSV into PostgreSQL via COPY.

- Exploratory queries: ride counts, booking status, top pickup hubs, payment method usage, revenue trends.

Advanced analytics:

🚕 Top drivers by rating & ride volume

📈 Monthly ride completion trends

💰 Top 5 customers driving revenue

❌ Cancellation patterns (customer vs. driver)

🌍 Ranking pickup locations by booking value

🔹 Why this project?

It transforms raw ride-booking data into actionable insights—useful for learning SQL, practicing analytics, or modeling real-world business KPIs in the ride-hailing domain.
