üöï Uber Ride Database SQL Project

A complete SQL project simulating an Uber-style ride booking system.
This project demonstrates database creation, data import from CSV, and SQL queries to analyze rides, customers, drivers, payments, and cancellations.

üìä Project Overview

This project answers key business questions for a ride-hailing platform using SQL queries. It includes:

- Managing Rides, Customers, Drivers, and Payments data

- Importing data from CSV into PostgreSQL

- Writing queries to analyze:

- Ride volumes and booking status

- Top pickup hubs and customer trends

- Cancellation patterns (customer vs. driver)

- Revenue and booking value insights

- Driver and customer performance ratings

- The project showcases SQL fundamentals such as joins, aggregations, GROUP BY, HAVING, ranking, and window functions to replicate real-world business analytics.
